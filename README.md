This simple file sharing application demonstrates understanding of how OOP works.
It also served as an exercise to practice my computer networking skills. I practiced using ports and IP addresses to establish a communication path between computers in two places in order to send data.
It also gave me a chance to see and understand how encryption works. I encrypted the file name before being sent and decoded it once received.
